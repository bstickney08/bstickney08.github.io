        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p>I personally read a lot of romance and fantasy books. My favorite series is called Fourth Wing. This book is a mix of romance and fantasy, containing dragons, a war college, and drama between a group of people. I read this book in just a couple of days, and the book was about 600 pages. I'm also reading the Harry Potter series as of right now. The details in the book are very similar to the movie details. I believe I read about 40 books in 2023.</p>
